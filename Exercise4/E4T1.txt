# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. Do not allow ssh from the public internet to the ec2 instances.
2. Restrict the IPs that are allowed to communicate to application server by providing CIDR block or exact IP address.
3. Prevent root account login over SSH
4. Configure to use complex passwords - more than 8 characters, and use of specific characters, and avoid password reuse 

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

- Currently, all S3 buckets are accessible from the application server. 
Instead of this, policy should define the specific bucket (Free Recipe) that should be accessible from the application server.
We can restrict the security policy of the instances to only have access to the free recipes bucket
- Enable server side encryption in the S3 bucket.
